## Description

This exercise attempts to implement three types of iterators (similar to those already implemented in the std library for C++): forward, reverse and bidirectional. 

The aim is to use generic functions and pointers, in order to create the implementation. 

## Good to Know

* Function Recorre uses the following paramters:
- [input] it: type of iterator that you want to use,
- [input] array: structure vector with array you want to iterate, 
- [input] forward: 0 in case you want to iterate forward or 1 if backward,
- [input] printThis: printing function for this type of data,
